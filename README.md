# GachaSimClient

This is the **client-side** application for the Gacha Simulation project 
It connects to the [GachaSimServer](https://github.com/ponlawat30109/GachaSimServer) to provide a complete gacha experience.

Users can interact with the gacha system visually, while all backend logic and data are handled by the server.

- **Update the server address in the config file:** `Assets/Scripts/Manager/ServerConfig.cs`
- Inside that file, change the `RemoteUrl` value to match your deployed server address:
